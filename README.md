## Description
  
This React Native application features user authentication, allowing users to securely log in and register using a backend API. The app leverages AsyncStorage for storing tokens locally, enabling persistent user sessions. Upon successful login, users are navigated through a tab-based interface with sections for Home, Search, Forum, and Profile. The app utilizes React Navigation for smooth transitions between screens and Expo for access to device features. The design is optimized for both iOS and Android devices, with custom color themes and responsive layouts.
